santa-packing
=============

Given a list of presents, pack them in Santa's sleigh as compactly as possible and in the best order possible. Contains both a naive solution and a solution using the DDS heuristic optimization algorithm. DDS is slow on this dataset so attempts were made to parallelize through MapReduce.
